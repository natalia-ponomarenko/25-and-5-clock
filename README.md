# Pomodoro clock

# Description
- The clock is a timer that can be set for a specific amount of time (default 25 minutes).
- It has a start/pause, and reset buttons, which allows the user to control the timer.
- The clock displays the amount of time remaining in the current Pomodoro session.
- When the timer reaches zero, an alarm sounds to indicate the end of the Pomodoro session.
- After each Pomodoro session, the clock automatically switches to a break timer, which can be set for a specific amount of time (default 5 minutes).
